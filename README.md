# Printer
SDL2 or ncurses character printing class library.
I made it during development of nrogue.git, somehow I managed to design good
cross-library method interface (at least I think so :-P).

Maybe this library will help somebody quickly build SDL2 or ncurses prototypes.

See example.cpp for example usage.
